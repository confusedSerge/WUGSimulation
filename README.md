# WUG Sampling

![Custom Randomwalk with Gambettes Stopping Criterion](/other/images/output.png)

This repository contains the code for the my bachelor thesis on the topic of ["Optimizing human annotation of word usage graphs in a realistic simulation environment"](http://dx.doi.org/10.18419/opus-11848) at the University of Stuttgart. In this thesis, I developed a simulation environment for the annotation of word usage graphs (WUGs) and evaluated the performance (Section 7) of different sampling strategies (Section 5.3), clustering strategies (Section 5.4) and stopping criteria (Section 5.5) for the annotation process. The annotation process in itself was also simulated using observations (Section 4) made on real world data (Section 3).

## Installation

The simulation environment is written in Python 3 and requires the following packages:
- See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for a complete list of dependencies.

Note, that the enviromnent during development underwent several changes, hence the requirements.txt file might not be up to date or contain unnecessary dependencies. This will be fixed in the future.

## Usage

> will add later, need to clean up code first, add documentation, use some kind of configuration file format, logging etc.
